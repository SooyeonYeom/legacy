## Hello World 

I am a college student majoring in Visual Design at Seoul National University.

Recently, I became interested in Development and started studying on my own. To study development in earnest, I opened a Git blog.

In this blog, I plan to post not only development studies, but also my design portfolios and art works.

See you again in the post.
